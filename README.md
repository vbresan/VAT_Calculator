## Contributing
### Updating VAT rates
This app keeps track of VAT rates for over 160 countries. Since VAT rates change occasionally, the app requires updates as well. All rates are defined in the [`rates.json`](https://github.com/vbresan/VAT_Calculator/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/rates.json) file. The file's syntax is straightforward, and no coding knowledge is necessary to update the file and correct the rates. 

Once your modifications are verified (it would be helpful if you provide the relevant source of information for corrected VAT rates), your changes will be merged, and an updated app will be released.

Note that the initial rates were sourced from [Wikipedia page "Value-added tax"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax). If you choose to update the app, please consider updating the Wikipedia page as well. Thank you!
